# FeedReader Testing 
> 

Web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Excersice to practice building test suites using Jasmine. Build tests to  test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

Used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository/ dowload the compressed files. 
2. To run the project load idex.html in your browser.
3. Scroll down to see results of the tests.
